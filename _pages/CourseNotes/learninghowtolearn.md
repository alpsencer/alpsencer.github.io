# Week 3
## Procrastination
### Tackling Procrastination - It is Easier, and More Valuable, Than You Think
- How to prevent procrastionation
- Zombie responses, you should make decisions not your zombies (habits)
	- Zombie mode: It refers to the relaxed state your mind enters when you are performing common and habitual tasks. Examples of zombie states and habitual behavior include riding a bike, getting dressed in the morning, and being able to back your car out of a driveway (if you are familiar and comfortable with driving).
- Reason: Cramming does not build better structrues![[Pasted image 20220525191630.png]]
- You should not waste your willpower to prevent procrastination

- Shares similaritiies with addiction
- Ex: Arsenic eater gradually immune it is similar to the habit of procrastination


### Zombies Everywhere
- Driving car, bicycle example
- Habits has 4 parts:
	1. The cue
		- Starts the zombie mode,  your reaction matter !!
			- It is perfectly normal to start with a few negative feelings about beginning a learning session‚Äîeven when it‚Äôs a subject you ordinarily like. It‚Äôs how you handle those feelings that matters.
	2. The routine 
	4. The reward - pleasure
	4. The Belief
		- To change your habit you should change your belief

### Surf is Up: Process Versus Product
- Negative thinking is bad
- Quit wasting time and start doing the job
- *Focus on process instead of product*
- Focusing on the product creates pain in the brain
	- Who cares what you do. The important thing is process

When the pain arises let it go.
Noise canceling headphones can help

### Harnessing Your Zombies to Help You
! As you automate you sometimes forget, prevent distractions before starting
1. The cue
	- location
	- time
	- how you feel
	- reactions
2. The Routine
	- plan - important
		- may not work but try to do
		- do not try to change everything at once
3. The reward
	- Even if it is small reward yourself
	- Bigger reward for bigger achievement
	- Creates neurological cravings
	- Expecting this reward allow you to create new habits
	- Before flow begins you have to study
4. Belief
	- Socialize with your friends who have same goals

What is the most common cue that launches you into procrastination mode? Is there a way you could avoid this without having to use a lot of willpower? Write your thoughts in the space below.

- the feeling of failure. i should let it go and focus on the task. but i should say this to my self loudly.


### Juggling Life and Learning
- A good way to keep perspective: 
	- Weekly list of key task (weekly) [[Daily journal]]
	- Making a task list free your memory
	- Mix tasks
	- Over time you will be better, realistic
	- Make notes in the [[Daily journal]]
	- Planning your quitting time is important
		 [[Cal Newport]] is a friend of [[Barbara Oakley]]
	- Eat the frog first

-  Making a task list is best done at night, right before you go to sleep. Research shows that this helps your zombies (subconscious processes) to process the list overnight, making it easier to work on your tasks the next day. #imp #dev

### Summing Up Procrastination
- Avoid cramming
- Keep a planner journal
	- What does and does not work
- Commit yourself to routines and tasks everyday
- Delay rewards until you finish task
- Watch for procrastination cues
- Gain trust in your new system
- Have backup plans for when you still procrastinate
- Eat the frog first

It is perfectly normal to start with a few negative feelings about beginning a learning session‚Äîeven when it‚Äôs a subject you ordinarily like. It‚Äôs how you handle those feelings that matters. #imp 

## Memory
### Diving deep into Memory
Mind easily remember visual spaces such as homes thanks to evolutionary development.
Because images directly connect to your visuouspatial area of your brain.
Beyond seeing:
- feel
- smell
- funnier and interesting is better remembered
- IT MUST BE REPEATED
- Flash cards
- Hand writing is better to remember something
	-   Handwriting appears to help you to more deeply encode (that is, convert into neural memory structures) what you are trying to learn.
- Say aloud
- Test yourself
- Interleave your learning (using methods above)
- Sleeping is important
- [[Anki]] is a good app

"People often under estimate the benefits of spaced repetition when learning"


### What is long term memory?
- Memory is not fixed it is changing
- DO NOT CRAM the info will quickly fade from your memory
- Astrocites 
	- Provide nutrients to neurons
	- involved after injury
	- ion balance
		- therefore, important job on learning
	- Einstein's brain has many more astrocites than average human

- Create similar groups and connect concepts

- Use [[Mnemonic]]
- [[Memory pallace technique]]

The more you use these techniques the more your memory muscles remember easier, faster.
The formulas will be remembered better
You just need to reach out the child inside you

### Summing up memory
- Long term memory
	- practice and repeat to retrieve info more easily
	- spaced repetation (tackling procrastion is important)
- Working memory
	- only 4 item can be stored but as you learn concepts they can compact into one and create space for new connections

Outstading visual memory system
- beyond seeing
	- feel
	- smell 
	- live in


- Create meaningful groups and abbreviations
	- [[Memory pallace technique]]
	- Mnemonics
